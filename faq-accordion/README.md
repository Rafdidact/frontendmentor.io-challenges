## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I had some problems with getting just the box to overflow and not
the women or the pattern in the desktop version.
I solved this by getting the cube out of the modal and making the overflow
of the last to be hidden.
Then I got the cube where I wanted with a position relative.
Not sure it was the most effective way though, feel free to send some feddback.

### Continued development

I definitely want to keep playing around with the z-index property and see what
amazing web designs I can build.
